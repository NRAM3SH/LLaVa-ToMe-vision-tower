# LLaVa with ToMe Token Merging

## Overview

This repository implements the Token Merging (ToMe) algorithm for the vision tower of the LLaVa (Large Language and Vision Assistant) model. The ToMe algorithm provides an efficient method for reducing computational complexity while maintaining model performance by strategically merging tokens during vision processing.
